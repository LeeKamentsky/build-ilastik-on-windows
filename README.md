# build-ilastik-on-windows
Build Ilastik and its dependencies using setuptools.

You should have CMake installed. On Windows, you should run this script within
the Microsoft SDK for Windows command-line shell or the Microsoft Visual C++
For Python 2.7 command-line shell.

At this point, this is an experimental attempt to create a setuptools setup.py file for building Ilastik 0.5 and Vigra. The goal is, given a Windows computer with Python, Visual C++ for Python 2.7 and CMake installed, to build a functional Ilastik package that can be used stand-alone or in conjunction with CellProfiler's ClassifyPixels module.

Most likely, this repo's ownership will be transferred to CellProfiler - please do not take it seriously yet.
